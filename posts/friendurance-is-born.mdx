# Introducing "Friendurance": Elevate Your Strava Experience

Friendurance isn't just another fitness dashboardâ€”it's where your personal Strava journey meets the collective drive of your team.
Strava has empowered us to conquer distances, but Friendurance amplifies the journey by turning every pace, every mile, and every coordinate into a collective celebration.

This 1st version of Friendurance features the following capabilities:

1. Log in via Strava
2. Join a team or create your own
3. View team aggregate metrics
4. View a global map of activities

Friendurance emerged from the idea that activity metrics are more fun to look at if not only viewed on an individual activity basis in the Strava app.
But much more if aggregated across time and friends.
